## Features

### Flight Strip Management
ATC24-Suite enables you to swiftly create, manage and delete flight strips by utilising intuitive keybinds.

### Built-In Ground Chart
The Suite automatically loads the correct aerodrome ground chart based on your airport selection.

### Custom Radar Screen
With the help of the Custom Radar, which is constantly updated with aerodrome data such as Runways, Cities, surrounding Terrain and [more to come](#Roadmap), your situational awareness is greatly improved, aiding you with descending traffic and vectoring them in for approach.
